               What are the best JDM cars in 2022?
            
            </h1>

                <p1> Searches for JDM cars are up on Auto Trader but what exactly are they and why is there such a fanbase?</br> In simple terms ‘JDM’ stands for Japanese Domestic Market,</br> and refers to cars originally sold in Japan but since imported to the UK for a second life on the other side of the world.</br> But why go to the bother?
                
                </p>

                <p>While performance models dominate some of the quirkier and less conventional JDM cars built for Japanese tastes have also found homes and an enthusiastic fanbase here in the UK.</br> Here are some of our favourites.

                        <div class="r34">
                            <li>R34 Skyline</li>
                            <p>Perhaps the most famous of all JDM cars, the Nissan Skyline was developed from a lineage of legendary touring cars that dominated Japanese motorsport from the late 60s onwards.</br> While Skylines raced outside of Japan – and crushed all before them – it wasn’t until Gran Turismo made it the poster car for the PlayStation generation that it really came to worldwide fame.</br> The R32, R33 and R33 GT-Rs of the late 90s and early 2000s are true modern icons,</br> Nissan officially importing a tiny number of the latter two versions into the UK at the time while many were also brought in privately.</br> Now of an age where American fans can now import them too, demand for old Skylines is up, and prices with it.</p>

                        <div class="subaru">
                            <li>Subaru Impreza</li>
                            <p>Before Colin McRae shot to rallying fame in the mid-90s Subaru was better known for building sturdy pick-ups and estate cars for farmers and other country types.</br> McRae’s achievements changed that pretty much overnight but, while Subaru sold turbocharged Imprezas that resembled his rally car here in the UK,</br> the WRX and STI versions the fans really wanted were never officially available outside of Japan.</br> That didn’t stop people bringing them over, though, and legendary JDM models like the 22B, Type R coupes and improbably named WRX STI Spec C Type RA-R still have a huge following, as have STI versions of other Subaru models like the Legacy and Forester.</p>

                        <div class="evo">
                            <li>Mitsubishi Evo</li>
                            <p>The Impreza’s nemesis in 90s rallying was also its biggest rival in its domestic market, the legendary Evo versions of the otherwise unremarkable Lancer saloon selling in huge numbers to home fans but rarely seen outside of Japan.</br> The Evo’s wild looks, innovative four-wheel drive technology, incredible performance and unobtainable nature all added to its exoticism and, through its first six generations, it was always a rarer sight than the Impreza, even in its heyday.</br> Those that did make it here were often driven hard, modified and otherwise thrashed so if you still crave a taste of 90s Evo craziness a fresh JDM import is still desirable.</p>

                            <li>Mazda FD RX7</li>
                            <p>You’ll be spotting a pattern by now but, while Mazda did sell the RX-7 in the UK,</br> the most exciting versions were reserved for the home market back in Japan.</br> The culture of building lots of limited editions all with confusingly abstract names and seemingly similar specifications adds to the sense of mystery,</br> highly desirable models like the Spirit R coming kitted out with tuned Bilstein suspension,</br> fancy lightweight wheels and racing seats denied to buyers of (relatively) toned down UK-spec ones.</br> Fast, beautiful, technically interesting for its rotary engine and truly lovely to drive,</br> the RX-7 is a true JDM icon.</p>
