<p>A grea"t chapter to wrap up the year folks! Lots of stuff to get into. First we have Bropper in the Mirror World trying to look for Luffy.</br> Funny, how they kept scaring everyone but I'm sure they will get to Luffy eventually, but they will probably have to fight Opera who is guarding Luffy and Nami's prison.</br> Then we have Pedro and Tamago fighting. Very high bounties, both of them. I didn't expect Dr. Eggman to be worth 429,000,000 belis</p>
