        </h1>

        <h2> Well, What is a red velvet cake?


        </h2>



        <div class="ingredients">

        <p>Red velvet cake is much more than vanilla cake tinted red.</br> This recipe produces the best red velvet cake with superior buttery, vanilla, and cocoa flavors, as well as a delicious tang from buttermilk.</br> My trick is to whip the egg whites, which guarantees a smooth velvet crumb.
        </p>

        <p> Ingredients for this red velvet cake follwos:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>300ml vegetable oil, plus extra for the tins</li>
                <li>500g plain flour</li>
                <li>2 tbsp cocoa powder</li>
                <li>4 tsp baking powder</li>
                <li>2 tsp bicarbonate of soda</li>
                 <li>560g light brown soft sugar</li>
                <li>1 tsp fine salt</li>
                <li>400ml buttermilk</li>
                <li>4 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                <li>30ml red food colouring gel or about Â¼ tsp food colouring paste</li>
                <li>4 large eggs</li>

    

        </ul>

        </div>



        <div class="methods">

        <p>Well, once we have gathered all the ingredients here is how to bake the cake!</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. </br>Oil and line the base and sides of two 20cm cake tins with baking parchment </br> if your cake tins are quite shallow, line the sides to a depth of at least 5cm.</li>
                <li>Put half each of the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, bicarb, sugar and salt in a bowl and mix well.</br> If there are any lumps in the sugar, squeeze these through your fingers to break them up.</li>
                <li>Mix half each of the buttermilk, oil, vanilla extract, food colouring and 100ml water in a jug.</br> Add 2 eggs and whisk until smooth. </br>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and whisk until well combined.</br> The cake mixture should be bright red, it will get a little darker as it cooks.</br> If its not as vivid as you would like, add a touch more colouring.</br> Pour the cake mixture evenly into the two tins, and bake for 25-30 mins, or until risen and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.</br> Cool in the tins for 10 mins, then turn out onto a wire rack, peel off the baking parchment and leave to cool.</li>
                <li>Repeat steps 1 and 2 with the remaining ingredients, so you have four sponge cakes in total.</li>
            </ol>
